        "Hue & You" was born during the isolation of the pandemic, inspired by
        the emotions of online strangers and the connections we forged in a time
        when physical distance defined our lives. Each piece in the series uses
        vibrant colors and bold, expressive forms to explore the raw feelings
        shared in digital spaces. These portraits became a kind of visual
        diary—a way to document how deeply we can connect, even when separated
        by screens. Through this work, I wanted to ask: What happens to our
        emotions when they're untethered from proximity? How can color express
        what words and actions often can’t? At its core, "Hue & You" is about
        the beauty and complexity of human connection, and how we find ways to
        bridge even the widest gaps.

        This series pulls from the bold, emotional use of color in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism" class="fauvism-link" target ="_blank"
          >Fauvism</a
        >, combined with the experimental textures and abstractions of
        contemporary digital art. The themes of isolation and connection are
        woven throughout, reflecting the universal desire to feel seen,
        understood, and close to one another—even in a time of distance.

      <p class="p1-context-desc">
        This project began with strangers—faces I stumbled across online. I
        didn’t know their names or their stories, but something about their
        expressions drew me in. Their faces became a canvas for my imagination,
        and I let my intuition guide the colors, shapes, and moods I brought to
        life. It wasn’t about capturing what they looked like but rather how
        they felt to me in that moment. Each portrait is less a reflection of
        reality and more a glimpse into the emotional stories I created for
        them.

      <p class="p1-reflection">What Do You See?</p>
      <p class="p1-context-desc">
        Every face tells a story, but what you see in the colors and lines might
        be completely different. What emotions or stories come to mind when you
        look at them?
