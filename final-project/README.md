### *Idea 1*

Music Map:

- What is the basic idea of your final project?

A collaborative platform for users to anonymously share songs that evoke memories of specific locations.

- How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?

The design of the site would be similar to the Unsent Project. However, on this page, users can search a certain location   and see all the results.
Use p5 library to create visuals that respond to user interaction on each “card,” like hovering or selecting locations.

- How do you plan to make your design accessible?

The information will be presented using clear, legible text. The design of the cards will be easy to read. The navigation will also be simple. 
I can use a library that allows me to incorporate text-to-speech. 

- What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?

The website will have location-based song entries with a description that users input. It allows users to search names of cities and find music that others have added that reminds them of that specific place. The entries & searches are all anonymous. 


### *Idea 2*

Art Exhibition

- What is the basic idea of your final project?

Create a personal webpage showcasing my artwork, while making a website that is art in itself.

- How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?

I will use p5 and Processing to add dynamic, generative elements to each page, such as animations and visuals that respond to user input. 

- How do you plan to make your design accessible?

I will incorporate clear navigation, readable text, alt descriptions for any visual images. 
If possible, I may also make sure that some of the elements can be accessed using the arrow keys. 

- What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?

I want to convey the inspiration and personal stories behind each artwork in a way that is fun and interactive for those seeing it. My artwork is currently displayed in a very plain, static way on my main portfolio. 


### *Idea 3*

Indian Classical Dance Gallery

- What is the basic idea of your final project?

An interactive website that introduces users to Indian classical dance. 
Show users elements like a gallery, sound bites, costumes, practices, etc. 

- How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?

I will use the p5 library and Processing to create animations and visual elements, such as sound visualizations, dance movements, and color visualizations. 
Additionally, I want to make it interactive by using parallax scrolling.

- How do you plan to make your design accessible?

I will ensure that any images I input have alt text. Any text on the page will be legible. I will also be using high contrast visuals.

- What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?

I would like to show users the beauty and history of Indian classical dance, and go in depth into aspects that are more unknown, such as fundamentals, hand gestures, expressions, costuming, etc. I would also like to explain the cultural significance of each element. 


## Feedback Summary

The concept of a Music Map was generally well-received. Two critiquers mentioned that it has a cool, engaging design style. They appreciated the “post-it note” style design inspiration as well as the idea behind the Unsent Project. This creates a casual, accessible experience that is easy to read and use, while allowing users to share personal experiences and song suggestions. The tone should be reflected in the interface design as well, focusing on simplicity over formality. A concern I had was that the idea may be too complicated to implement into code. To make it easier, it was suggested to “dumb down” the concept by not requiring exact location tagging, but instead allowing users to manually input names of locations by typing or using a drop down. One critiquer mentioned that error prevention is key here - adding options to delete or edit notes in the case of accidental submission would be useful. Additionally, someone else mentioned that dropdowns would help prevent misspellings. However, this may be more complicated, as it would require a location database. In regards to filtering data and responses, someone suggested that it may be beneficial to allow users to filter by genre of music in addition to the location search. A few critiquers felt that a map view would be crucial, and suggested using the VegaLite framework to incorporate that in a creative way. Overall, this idea was liked and found to be creative. 
The Art Exhibition overall received positive feedback, especially regarding the interactive nature of the website. A few were confused about where this page would be located, but understood once I explained that it would be linked within my main portfolio. The ideas should be organized in a certain way that allows for a cohesive experience for the viewer, such as by themes, collections, or even color. One suggestion I received was to create a dynamic layout, like a collage, or a 3D (Z-axis) approach, instead of a card-by-card format, which felt too static. It was suggested thinking of this like a digital exhibit, focusing on intentional layouts. Additionally, animations could enhance the experience but should be subtle enough to avoid overwhelming viewers. This would allow for personal experimentation as my work evolves. It was also suggested that I create this in the mindset of a game designer, where users are able to use arrow keys to interact with the elements on the screen. Overall, this idea was received positively, and was the most favored. This idea is also one that I would be able to build on in the future, and incorporate easily into my existing portfolio. 
I didn’t receive much feedback for the Dance Gallery project idea, as I focused more time during the critique session on the other ideas. The idea, focused on educating people about Bharatanatyam, was seen as potentially too time-consuming for the value it would add. Most feedback suggested that it might be the least engaging of the three, and could be challenging to create content for. 

## Feedback Digestion

Based on the feedback I received during the lab, I decided to narrow my ideas down to two and reflect on which aspects of the critique I would incorporate. After considering the feedback for the dance gallery idea, I decided not to move forward with this option. 
Within the Music Map, I plan on incorporating several key suggestions to improve both functionality and design. First, the “post-it note” inspiration from the Unsent Project was widely appreciated, and will be incorporated into my final design if I choose this idea. This design style keeps the interface simple, making it easy to navigate. Additionally, it creates an inviting interface that encourages personal sharing. Addressing concerns about complexity, I have decided to incorporate the suggestions given to me within my process. I agree with my critiquers that it would be a good idea to omit the location tagging aspect and instead allow users to simply type location in or select from a dropdown menu. To prevent any errors, I will also add options to delete any submissions to account for accidental entries. One critiquer suggested that I should allow users to filter by genre of music. However, I will not be incorporating this feedback, as it takes away from the main intention of the webpage and adds unnecessary complexity. A critique I received a few times was that a map view of all user responses would be crucial. This is feedback that I am considering incorporating, however, it is going to depend on difficulty and timelines. Additionally, I’m unsure if this would add a “social-media” style element to the page which strays from the original idea of the site. 
For the Art Exhibition, it was suggested that I organize the artwork in a specific way. I have decided to incorporate that feedback and order the artwork based on individual collections. Each art “collection” will have its own page. This will allow me to create a site that can be constantly updated as I create new work in the future. Furthery, I will be presenting the artwork in a dynamic fashion, creating an experience for the user. I’m still unsure of how I will be doing this, but I will ensure that the elements do not seem boring and static on the screen using interesting layouts and animations. I will keep in mind as I design this that I need to ensure not to overwhelm people with the visual elements. From the critique I also received feedback I might incorporate, but am not sure about. It was also suggested that I create this in the mindset of a game designer, where users are able to use arrow keys to interact with the elements on the screen. Once I design the layout and prototype the user interactions, I will be able to determine whether this is a route I should take or not.
