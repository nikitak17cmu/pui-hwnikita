      <h2 class="p1-context">Context</h2>
      <p class="p1-context-desc">
        This piece focuses on the quiet elegance of a piano and sheet music,
        captured in a romantic impressionistic style reminiscent of Bridgerton.
        The soft brushstrokes and warm tones create a sense of intimacy, drawing
        attention to the elegance of the objects themselves rather than any
        surrounding environment.
        <br />
        The scene feels like a moment frozen in time, where the piano and sheet
        music stand still, awaiting the music that could come to life at any
        moment. It's about the stillness and anticipation, the beauty in the
        simplicity of these elements, and the way they seem to hold a story all
        on their own.

      <p class="p1-context-desc">
        The process of creating this work involved carefully building layers
        with both acrylic and oil paints. Acrylics were used for their ability
        to dry quickly, allowing me to layer colors and build depth. Oil paints,
        on the other hand, added richness and fluidity, helping me to achieve
        the soft, dreamy texture that defines the piece.

      <p class="p1-context-desc">
        This painting draws inspiration from the emotional intensity of Romantic
        Impressionism, a style that emerged in the late 1800s.

          >J.M.W. Turner, the famous British painter</a
        >
        known for his turbulent skies and dramatic seascapes, helped pave the
        way for this movement. Like Turner's work, this piece uses a dramatic
        red background to create atmosphere, while adopting the softer, looser
        brushwork that Impressionists later made famous. You can see this
        especially in how the sheet music is painted â€“ not perfectly detailed,
        but captured in a way that gives you the feeling of aged paper and
        handwritten notes. The whole piece balances drama with intimacy, much
        like the artists of that era who wanted their work to be both
        emotionally powerful and personally touching.
