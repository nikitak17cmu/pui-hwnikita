        With "Reveries," I wanted to dive into the intricate world of fabrics and textures—velvet, lace, glitter, and more. This series is an exploration of how materials can tell their own story, even without the presence of a figure.

        Each piece focuses entirely on the clothing, allowing the textures and folds to take center stage. I challenged myself to lean into a more realistic style, bringing out the richness and detail of every stitch, sparkle, and drape. It’s less about who might wear these garments and more about the quiet beauty of the materials themselves.</p>

        "Reveries" opened the door to even more possibilities for exploring textures. In future work, I want to push further—perhaps combining textures with movement or exploring fabrics in surreal settings.
